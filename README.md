## About Me
I'm Kayode from the UK and I am a front-end developer. Welcome to my Github! 😄 
I’m currently improving my skillset in React and I am excited to learn even more frameworks and languages which will help. Building responsive and engaging         webpages and learning more about relevant software is what I am interested in. I don't have the typical pathway into Tech but I find the challenging nature of coding exciting and rewarding! Stay connected and tuned into my Profile to see my development 🎆
